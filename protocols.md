# Clinical Protocols

## Ictal Agency Dissociation (IAD) Protocol

**Definition:** Transient loss of behavioral agency during cluster headache attack >60 minutes.

**Critical Threshold:** 60 minutes of attack duration
- **< 45 min:** Patient retains full agency, can self-administer treatment
- **45-60 min:** Warning zone, declining executive control
- **> 60 min:** IAD zone, neurophysiological collapse of regulatory systems

**Emergency Protocol for IAD:**
1. **Physical safety first:** Patient may not be able to communicate intent
2. **External medication administration:** Do not wait for explicit consent
3. **Verbal reassurance:** Patient retains consciousness and memory (don't shout)
4. **Post-ictal monitoring:** Recovery of agency takes 15-30 minutes after pain cessation

## Risk Assessment

**Demoralization (primary predictor):**
- Odds Ratio ≈ 6.66 for suicidality
- NOT the same as depression
- Markers: Hopelessness, feelings of entrapment, cognitive rigidity

**Protective factors:**
- Social connection
- Sense of meaning/purpose
- Problem-solving flexibility

## Venous Pathology Considerations

For patients with venous congestion (jugular stenosis, CCSVI):
- Monitor SpO2 trends more closely
- Higher risk of nocturnal attacks due to venous pooling
- Consider positional factors in period prediction

## Epistemic Justice Warning

**Why patients hide symptoms:**
- Fear of psychiatric stigma ("it's just in your head")
- Previous dismissal by healthcare providers
- Fear of losing employment/license

**How this model helps:**
- Objective physiological prediction reduces burden of "proof"
- Early warning allows preventive treatment without "proving" severity
- Validates invisible suffering through biomarkers

## Training Data Requirements

**Minimum viable dataset:**
- 90 days continuous monitoring per patient
- At least 2 cluster periods observed
- Hourly resolution for core signals (SpO2, HR)
- Any biomarker coverage (even 1-2% helps)

**Ethical collection:**
- Informed consent for IAD risk prediction
- Clear explanation that model predicts risk, not certainty
- Right to withdraw without losing medical care
